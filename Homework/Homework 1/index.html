    <p style="background-color: blueviolet;">My search for the best homemade margherita pizza (made in a standard oven
        with everyday ingredients) is over! You’ll want to make this homemade pizza recipe over and over again. </p>

    <h3>Pizza Dough Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Yeast:</strong>Instant yeast makes the job quicker.</li>
        <li> <strong>Water:</strong>Use warm water to reduce the rise time, about 105ºF – 115ºF. Anything over 130ºF is
            too hot.</li>
        <li> <strong> Flour:</strong>It’s best to use unbleached all-purpose white flour in the pizza crust. Bleaching
            the flour strips away some of the protein, which reduces the amount of water the flour can absorb.</li>
        <li> <strong>Oil:</strong>Extra virgin olive oil adds wonderful flavor. Don’t forget to brush the dough with
            olive oil before adding the toppings, which prevents the crust from tasting soggy.</li>
        <li> <strong>Salt & Sugar:</strong>Salt adds flavor and sugar increases the yeast’s activity and tenderizes the
            dough</li>
        <li> <strong>Cornmeal:</strong>Use cornmeal to dust the pizza pan; it gives the pizza crust a little extra
            flavor and crisp.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Margherita Pizza Toppings</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>For absolute best flavor, use homemade roasted garlic</li>
        <li>Use your favorite homemade tomato sauce.</li>
        <li>Top with good quality mozzarella.</li>
        <li>And fresh juicy tomatoes, any size.</li>
        <li>Plus lots of fresh basil. And bonus if the basil is from your garden.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Prepare pizza dough through step 5, including preheating the oven to 475°F (246°C). Cover the shaped dough
            lightly with plastic wrap and allow it to rest as the oven preheats.</li>
        <li>Mix the olive oil and chopped garlic together in a small dish. Brush the top of the dough lightly with olive
            oil. Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Top with pizza sauce,
            then the mozzarella cheese slices, then the tomato slices.</li>
        <li>Bake for 14-16 minutes or until the crust is lightly browned and the cheese is bubbling. For the last
            minute, I move the oven rack to the top rack to really brown the edges. That’s optional.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and top with fresh basil and pepper. Slice pizza and serve immediately.</li>
        <li>Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be
            frozen up to 3 months. See pizza crust recipe for instructions on freezing the pizza dough.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Whisking while adding oil emulsifies the dressing for a smooth and creamy (not oily) consistency.</li>

    <h3>How to Make Caesar Salad</h3>
